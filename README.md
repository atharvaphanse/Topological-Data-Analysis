# Topological-Data-Analysis

I just got introduced to this exciting field called Topological Data Analysis! This program is an interactive tool for understanding persistence diagram of 2D point clouds

Here are some videos to get an introduction:

I have not studied the subject long enough to provide an introduction but let me try to give an idea about what the code is about.
Basically, we want to get information about properties of a given point cloud and persistence diagrams are in some sense a tool to visualize these properties. For example, we would like to know if the points form loops, if yes how many? etc.

I made this tool to make the persistence diagram of a drawing (2D) made with the mouse. The code creates a pygame window just like Paint, move click the mouse button and your cursorto draw a "point cloud" and the code will then output the persistence diagram of that point cloud. Experimenting by drawing different shapes can perhaps help understand persistence diagram better!
